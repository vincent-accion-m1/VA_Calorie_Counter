![forthebadge](https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png)

This is a Python project made for an assignement in a M1 programming course - master A.I.R.E -. The goal of this code is to compute the price and calorie amount of any combinaison of meals and their different names from a given database. Once a sequence of meal ID and/or food names is entered, the program gives two output : a calorie amount and the price of the whole order. 

## To Start

The file ``main_order_class.py`` is the only file you'll need to modify to try out the code. Search inside of the JSON files (``data/combos.json`` & ``data/meals.json``) for a sequence of meals you'd like to try out, and enter them in the list at the start of  ``main_order_class.py`` called ``item_list`` as follow :
```

items_list: list = ["what ever you want here"]

```
